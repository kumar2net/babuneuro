# Product Requirements Document: Deep Learning in Neurology

**Date:** July 30, 2025

## 1. Overview

The goal of this project is to create a system for staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in deep learning models applied to neurology, specifically in the areas of surgery and neural implants. The system will leverage an agentic workflow to gather, process, and present this information on a weekly basis.

## 2. Objectives

*   **Knowledge Acquisition:** Systematically gather information about new and existing deep learning models used in neurological surgery and implants.
*   **Information Synthesis:** Process the collected data to extract key insights, including model architectures, training data, performance metrics, and real-world applications.
*   **Regular Updates:** Implement an automated, agentic workflow to refresh the knowledge base on a weekly basis.
*   **Presentation:** Display the curated information in a clear and accessible format.

## 3. Scope

### In Scope:

*   Research papers, articles, and pre-prints related to deep learning in neurology.
*   Information on specific deep learning models, their architectures, and their applications.
*   Agentic workflow for automated information gathering.
*   Weekly updates to the knowledge base.

### Out of Scope:

*   Building or training new deep learning models.
*   Clinical trials or patient data analysis.
*   Commercial product development.

## 4. Functional Requirements

*   **Data Collection Agent:** An agent capable of searching for and retrieving relevant literature and articles from various online sources (e.g., PubMed, arXiv, Google Scholar).
*   **Data Processing Agent:** An agent that can read and summarize the collected documents, extracting the key information mentioned in the objectives.
*   **Reporting Mechanism:** A way to present the summarized information, potentially by updating a section of the `index.html` or another designated file.
*   **Scheduler:** A mechanism to trigger the agentic workflow on a weekly basis.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Maintainability:** The agentic workflow should be easy to understand, modify, and extend.
*   **Reliability:** The system should consistently perform its weekly updates.
*   **Accuracy:** The information gathered and presented should be accurate and well-sourced.

## 6. Success Metrics

*   Consistent and timely weekly updates.
*   The breadth and depth of the collected information on deep learning models.
*   Clarity and usefulness of the presented information.
